# STM32U5xx_DFP

This is the development repository for the **STMicroelectronics STM32U5 Series Device Family Pack (DFP)** - a CMSIS software pack that is designed to work with all compiler toolchains (Arm Compiler, GCC, IAR, LLVM). It is released as [CMSIS software pack](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/STM32U5xx_DFP-keil) and therefore accessible by CMSIS-Pack enabled software development tools.

This DFP uses the generator integration of the [CMSIS-Toolbox to Configure STM32 Devices with CubeMX](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/CubeMX.md) that is also supported in ÂµVision 5.40 an higher.

> **Note:** This is currently Work in Progress. Final release is expected in Q3'2024.

## Usage

The device is configured using [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html). For additional information refer to:

- [CMSIS-Toolbox - Configure STM32 Devices with CubeMX](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/CubeMX.md) for usage information of STM32CubeMX with CMSIS projects.

## Using the development repository

This development repository can be used in a local directory and [mapped as software pack](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/build-tools.md#install-a-repository) using for example `cpackget` with:

    cpackget add <path>/ARM.STM32U5xx_DFP.pdsc

## Generate software pack

The software pack is generated using bash shell scripts.

- `./gen_pack.sh` (provided via [Open-CMSIS-Pack/gen-pack](
https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/gen-pack)) generates the software pack. Run this script locally with:

      STM32U5xx_DFP $ ./gen_pack.sh

### GitHub Actions

The repository uses GitHub Actions to generate the pack, publish documentation, and verify reference applications:

- `.github/workflows/pack.yml` based on [Open-CMSIS-Pack/gen-pack-action](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/gen-pack-action) generates pack and documentation using the [Generate software pack](#generate-software-pack) scripts.
